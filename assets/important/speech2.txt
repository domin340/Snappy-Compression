Good morning everyone,

Thank you all for gathering here today to talk about one of the most pressing issues of our time our environment.
We live in a world blessed with breathtaking landscapes, diverse ecosystems,
and resources that sustain our way of life. But the health of our planet is in jeopardy. Every day,
forests shrink, oceans warm, and pollution increases.

This isn’t just about nature; it’s about us. It’s about the air we breathe,
the water we drink, and the food we eat. Every small action we take can make a difference.
Recycling, conserving energy, and reducing waste are steps that each of us can embrace in our daily lives.
And beyond these personal choices,
we need to support policies that prioritize sustainable development and protect our natural resources for future generations.

So let us commit to being stewards of this Earth.
Let us lead by example and inspire those around us to act responsibly.
Together, we can create a world where nature and humanity coexist in harmony.
Thank you.
